            <p>
                I've been studying/working with frontend developmet for 3 years, mainly using Angular 2.
                <br/>Since I use more Angular than React I had to adapt and remember the basic (I'm a fast learner), but it didn't took much time.
                <br/>I hope that the results are satisfatory.
                <br/>Thanks!
            </p>
